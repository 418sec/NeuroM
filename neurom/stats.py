    Parameters:
        data: array of data points to be fitted
        distribution (str): type of distribution to fit. Default 'norm'.

    Returns:
        tuple (parameters, (distance, p-value)) of data to fitted distribution

    Note:
        Uses Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to estimate distance and p-value.
