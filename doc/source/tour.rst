A Tour of NeuroM
****************

This is a more in-depth guide to ``NeuroM``. It will consist of explanations of the
overall design philosophy and the main components. The target audience consists of
users who want to perform analyses beyond what is described in the quick and easy

Some information will be taken from the `NeuroM Cookbook <https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/spaces/display/BBPSUBSIM/NeuroM+Cookbook>`_ page.
